## How to Run the Bot

1. **Install Python**:
   - Download and install Python from the official website. Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Open your command prompt or terminal and install the required libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install discord.py
     pip install transformers
     pip install torch
     pip install requests
     pip install pillow
     ```

3. **Set Up Your Bot Token**:
   - Replace the placeholder token in the `client.run('your_token')` line with your actual Discord bot token. 
   - For Replit users:
     ```python
     client.run(os.getenv('SECRET_KEY'))
     ```

4. **Set Up Your Hugging Face API Key**:
   - Replace the placeholder in the `headers` dictionary with your actual Hugging Face API key:
     ```python
     headers = {
         "Authorization": "Bearer your_hugging_face_api_key",  # Replace with your Hugging Face API key
         "Content-Type": "application/json"
     }
     ```

5. **Run Your Bot**:
   - Save your script as `main.py` and run it using:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

6. **Verify Operation**:
   - Ensure that the bot is running correctly by checking the console for any errors and confirming that it is online in your Discord server.
